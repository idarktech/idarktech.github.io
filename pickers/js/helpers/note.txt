before updating any of the files. Please be reminded that 
bootstrap-formhelpers-colorpicker.js line 46 and 121 must have the code below
This is to fix the problem for canvas on IE8
if (!document.createElement('canvas').getContext) {
    return;
}

do not attempt to use excanvas.js as its not going to work for some unknown reason.
